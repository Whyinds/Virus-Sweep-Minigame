## Summary
Virus Sweep is a minigame built in Unity with C#, created for a college course. It won Kinematifest 2025's "Best Independent Game" Award!
This is the project's assets and code, although I learned better programming skills later on.

Use your mouse to aim and and click to shoot projectiles at incoming enemies. Your ball can pierce some enemies and bounce off walls, scoring points. After you defeat 3 bosses (clippy) you win! If the enemies get to your files and damage it enough, you lose!
